    <meta name="description" content="杨丹华, before these memories of her have faded for the second time or an electromagnetic pulse erases everything overnight. longer version: i first met this uniquely amazing human being when i was a fourth grader, but too soon afterwards our paths diverged (or rather, began to intersect with those of many others) without me realizing that a) i'd been so fortunate to have a window seat to catch a glimpse of the childhood version of her every weekend or so, but that would be gone forever; b) she had walked in and out of my life, and marked her place unexpectedly, only to be uncovered by myself on my indefinite return. this certainly sounds slightly far-fetched. i barely knew her (perhaps some dictionary-makers may even be reluctant to categorize us as acquaintances), but i knew enough not to be surprised that she was like no other in every aspect possible, and she would go on to live deeper than a superficial life. looking back, it wouldn't have changed much even if the pendulum had swung sharply towards the opposite direction, at any rate. none. zip. zero. zilch. yet what do i pine for? i tend to think that at no point in all those halcyon days did i ever consciously decide my heart had found peace in front of her. but then what has this dream gotten me into now? this elusive emotion or whatever appears to have awakened and surfaced from nowhere. but it's not budding out of the blue. it's not like i've lived my life as if this unrequited something never existed. but just because i was ignorant of its existence doesn't mean it wasn't there. and it was by no means ephemeral in a span of one's lifetime. i overthink things and constantly ask myself the metronomic question as to when this will come to an end, six months, two years, or five. once it gets past a certain point, it never goes away. there is no quick litmus test for this purpose. her beautiful soul might have even vanished, i wouldn't know. as the days turn into months and then so forth, it doesn't add up, it multiplies, in a negative way, almost like the culmination of 20+ years of her disappearance and entropy. i should see the writing on the wall that tuesday morning if my eyes were hooked up right. going off the deep end, not that i need escapism, but wish i could touch the pause button, and just get lost in reflection. i can't blindly run off with a squeal of relief, i have to come to terms with it someday and eventually put this page out to pasture. 'too old to make a mess', this is going to be an emotional battle with myself. grow a spine, please. but in my next life, whether it will be the second or umpteenth attempt, i will do everything to avoid meeting her/him too young and then start looking for her/him once I turn 17. that's wishful nonsense, as there is only an infinitesimal chance our souls will be reincarnated as same species at around same time. but let me remain agnostic till then.">
